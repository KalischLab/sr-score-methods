Welcome to the Git repository for information on how to quantify stress resilience in humans using residual-based methods, in particular the 'stressor reactivity' (SR) score.

In the publication folder you can find basic methods papers, examples of studies using the SR score or related residual methods, and a non-exhaustive collection of studies suitable for SR scoring.

In the Presentations folder you will find materials (slides) from a workship, ranging from a general introduction, the basic methods, advanced methods and trajectory-based calculations.

You will also find accompanying R Markdown scripts for the course:

- basic_sr_demo.Rmd

- basic_sr_worksheet.Rmd

- advanced_sr_demo.Rmd

- advanced_sr_worksheet.Rmd

- trajectories.Rmd
